\question 
Two concentric cicrles are of radii 4cm and 3cm.Find the length of the chord of the larger cicrle which touches the smaller cicle.

\question
In figure 1,a triangle ABC \angle B=90 \degree is shown.Taking AB as diameter,a cicrle has benn drawn intersecting AC at point P.Prove that  the tanget drawn at point P bisects BC
